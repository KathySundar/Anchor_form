        <p>
            Jeffry prior to being CTO at MayaData has worked at several other startups in the storage industry. 
            He worked on several scale-out object storage products as well as traditional NAS and SAN storage solutions where he 
            held technical leadership roles. At MayaData, his primary focus is to make sure the product is flexible and scalable. 
            At the same time, robust enough to be integrated seamlessly into modern-day infrastructure where he believes, 
            containers will have a dominant role. Jeffry holds a master's degree in electrical engineering with a focus on distributed control engineering from the University of Twente in the Netherlands. When he is not working with code, he practices martial arts.

        <h3  id="s2"><strong>LIZ RICE</strong></h3>
        <p>
            I love making, understanding & explaining code.  My background and core competence is systems software engineering, but I love the whole process of building products. I've been in startups that have succeeded and others that have failed. I enjoy writing code, and understanding how other people will use it. I'm Chief Open Source Officer with eBPF pioneers Isovalent, creators of the Cilium project, which provides cloud native networking, observability and security. Prior to that I was VP Open Source Engineering with security specialists Aqua Security. I'm chair of the CNCF's Technical Oversight Committee, and I co-chaired the KubeCon / CloudNativeCon 2018 events in Copenhagen, Shanghai and Seattle. I'm also an Ambassador for Open UK.  When I'm not working you'll quite likely find me on a bike (in real life or racing on Zwift), at a gig, eating & drinking with friends, doing yoga or making music. You might see my drum kit in the background on Zoom calls - I'm a mediocre drummer at best, but it's fun!

        <h3 id=Q1>How are conference hotels chosen?</h3>
        <p>
            We submit our profile to hotels to prepare bids; staff reviews the bids and makes recommendations to the Executive Committee. Sometimes staff will complete a site visit to see if the hotel will meet our needs. We must do that several years in advance to guarantee the dates and to ensure the best rates possible. That means we must make our best estimate several years in advance about how many members could attend our annual meeting, so that we meet our obligations to the hotel and have facilities that are the right size.

        <h3 id=Q2>Can you book a budget hotel too, so that we have a choice?</h3>
        <p>
            In a word, no. We get our meeting rooms for the conference by promising the conference hotel that we will fill a minimum number of sleeping rooms for a given number of nights and sign a contract to that affect. If our members don’t fill that block of rooms because they are staying somewhere else, NAPCRG must pay the difference directly to the hotel. Further, our audio visual charges are negotiated on the assumption that we are bringing that much income for the hotel (the charges are also based on the number of rooms needing the equipment), so other rates would go up as well if we failed to meet our minimum. If we promised fewer room nights when we sign the contract, the hotel would not give us enough meeting rooms for our conference sessions. A budget hotel is less expensive because almost all of its square footage is for sleeping rooms, so it can charge a lower rate for those rooms. Therefore, less expensive hotels don't have the meeting rooms or audio visual services to serve us. They are often in less desirable locations where the real estate is less expensive. After we've filled our contracted quota with the main hotel and a need for an overflow hotel becomes necessary, there may be an option to book a second bargain hotel to offer conference participants. Staying in the conference hotel is the most convenient choice for NAPCRG members and supports NAPCRG and our meeting needs.

        <h3 id=Q3>What goes into a hotel contract?</h3>
        <p>
            Basic Agreement: When we make an agreement with a hotel, we promise that our members will fill a given number of sleeping rooms each night for a given number of nights; we also promise to spend a minimum amount for food and beverage. In return, they offer us a discounted rate on those sleeping rooms and the use of meeting rooms for our sessions. This contract is signed about five years prior to the meeting. Audio-visual: Major hotels are able to offer us excellent audio-visual service and support. It is usually provided by a separate company that works with many hotels in the city. We pay for the support in the meeting rooms for each day of use.

        <h3 id=Q4>How do audio-visual requests work?</h3>
        <p>
            Most conference hotels hire the services of a separate company to provide audio-visual facilities. At conference time, their representatives at the hotel set up the equipment, check for problems and remain on call to troubleshoot. Their fees are based on the setup in a given number of rooms for a given number of days, and the equipment in each room. If we ask for equipment in a room and use it for just one session, we are still charged for the whole day. NAPCRG brings our own computers and projectors to lessen av costs. Av charges for our conference are approximately $45,000 for just a basic support package. If we rented their computers and projectors it raise the equipment fees enormously, and thus it would raise conference registration fees.

        <h3 id=Q5>Why didn’t I get free wifi in my hotel room?</h3>
        <p>
            Connectivity technology changes so quickly that it seldom goes into a hotel contract. Some hotels still see wifi as a profit center, much as they used to see long distance phone charges. Others see connectivity as an important part of creating goodwill and loyalty.

        <h3 id=Q6>Why was my session scheduled at the same time as other sessions on similar topics?</h3>
        <p>
            The program takes place over several days with many scheduled sessions, and some conflicts are unavoidable. The Program Committee works hard to avoid conflicts of topics and potential audiences. The first priority, however, must be avoiding individual conflicts: a participant cannot moderate one session and present a paper at the same time. Special scheduling requests can contribute to conflicts as well. If a series of five sessions is organized and the organizers want to maintain a particular order, that limits the scheduling of other sessions around it. Any special scheduling request may have a ripple effect in order to avoid individual conflicts. Ideally, similar topics follow one another in the same room for the sake of continuity.
